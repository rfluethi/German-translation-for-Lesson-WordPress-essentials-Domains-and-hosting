# GitHub Actions Workflows - Overview

After cleanup, there are only **2 important workflow files**:

## Current Workflows

### 1. release.yml **ACTIVE - FUNCTIONAL**

- **Status:** Fully functional - LFS problem solved
- **Purpose:** Creates release ZIP files with complete LFS files
- **Features:**
  - LFS integration works (40MB video instead of 133 bytes pointer)
  - ZIP files contain real LFS files
  - 1.3GB artifacts - confirms complete LFS integration
  - Successful verification of all critical files

### 2. release-fixed.yml **DEVELOPMENT**

- **Status:** Development version
- **Purpose:** Identical to release.yml - development copy
- **Usage:** For testing improvements

### 3. release-backup.yml.disabled **DISABLED**

- **Status:** Deactivated - caused conflicts
- **Purpose:** Old workflow (created only pointer files)
- **Note:** This was the problem - was executed incorrectly

## Usage

### For Release Creation

- **Automatic:** Create a GitHub Release → Workflow runs automatically
- **Manual:** GitHub → Actions → "Create Release with LFS Files (Fixed)" → Run workflow

### For Development

- Edit release-fixed.yml for tests
- Copy working changes to release.yml

## Cleaned Up (deleted)

- release-new.yml
- release-simple-fixed.yml
- release-simple.yml
- release-ultimate.yml
- release-working.yml
- release-backup.yml (now disabled - caused conflicts)

## Result

- **Only 2 active files** instead of 8
- **Clear structure:** Active / Development
- **Easy maintenance**

**The active workflow (release.yml) has successfully solved the LFS problem and creates ZIP files with complete large files!**

## SUCCESS - LFS Problem Solved

**Confirmed functional:**

- Video file: **40,631,177 bytes** (40MB) instead of 133 bytes pointer
- Videos ZIP: **39MB** with real LFS files
- Total artifact: **1.3GB** - confirms complete LFS integration
- All ZIP files contain real LFS files, not just pointers

**Ready for production! You can now create releases that generate complete ZIP files with all LFS files.**
