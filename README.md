Production documents for the learning materials, along with a detailed overview of the directory structure, are available in [REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE](REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md).

### Video
The “[Video](media/video)” directory contains the finished learning videos that have been created in the current version.

### Text Materials

The text materials include the complete transcript of the instructional video, encompassing all spoken passages. Additionally, they contain summaries, chapter overviews, and other content. The material is available both in the [original English version](docs/text-material-en.md) and in a [German version](docs/text-material-de.md), which has not only been translated but also adapted to align with German learning materials.
