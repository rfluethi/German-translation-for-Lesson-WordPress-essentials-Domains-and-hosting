# Shot List

This document provides a detailed list of the software and materials used in the video, along with their respective licences.

Timecodes are given in either the Audio Timecode Format (ATF) "hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds" or the Video Timecode Format (VTF) "hours:minutes:seconds;frames". Unless otherwise specified, this file follows the Video Timecode Format (VTF).

## Production Software

Unless stated otherwise, all images were specifically created for this video.

### Design and Illustration Software

The static vector graphics and designs for the animated elements were created using [Affinity Designer 2.6.0](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/).

The image material can be found in the directory [../src/assets/image-material](../src/assets/image-material) in the formats [Affinity Designer](../../src/assets/image-material/domain-hosting-design-material.afdesign), [SVG](../src/assets/image-material/domain-hosting-design-material.svg) and [PDF](../src/assets/image-material/domain-hosting-design-material.pdf).

### Animation Software

The animation sequences were produced using [Moho Pro 14](https://moho.lostmarble.com/).

Animations are organised into chapter-based scenes, each stored in separate directories. Each scene directory contains the corresponding Moho file, a video of the scene, and folders containing the images and videos used. Vector graphics are integrated directly into the Moho file.

All animations can be found in the chapter directories under [../src/assets/animation/chapters](../src/assets/animation/chapters).

### Audio Software

The initial voice recordings in German and English were generated using [Soundly-Voices 2025.01.42](https://getsoundly.com/).

To ensure precise synchronisation of the animation and accessibility for non-German speakers, the speaker’s voice was initially recorded in both German and English using artificial speech synthesis. This also simplifies later dubbing by a real speaker.

The text used can be found in the [Text Material](docs/text-material.md) file.

#### Audio German

**Voice:** Sara B. | **Speed:** 0.80  
Files are stored in [../src/audio/voices/synthetic-DE](../src/audio/voices/synthetic-DE).

#### Audio English (UK)

**Voice:** Rebecca E. | **Speed:** 0.80  
Files are stored in [../src/audio/voices/synthetic-EN](../src/audio/voices/synthetic-EN) .

### Video Editing

The sequences were assembled, and audio was added using [Camtasia 2025](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/).

The final video was produced in 1920x1080 resolution at 30 frames per second.

Production files can be found in [../src/assets/video](../src/assets/video)
