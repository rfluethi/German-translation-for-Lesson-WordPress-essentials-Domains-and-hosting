### Title

WordPress essentials: Domains and hosting

### Introduction

Hi, and welcome to Learn WordPress. In this tutorial, we’ll be discussing an essential aspect of setting up your website, choosing the right website domain and hosting provider.

### Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this lesson are to differentiate between domains and hosting, describe what it means to bundle domains and identify factors to consider when choosing a hosting company.

### Understanding Domains and Hosting

Let’s start by clarifying the difference between a host and a domain. Imagine your website is a mobile home and your domain is the address, and your host as the land where your house or website is built. A domain is the unique web address that visitors type into their browsers to find your site. For example, the domain name for the official Coca-Cola website is www.cococolacompany.com. On the other hand, a host is a service that stores your website’s files and makes them accessible to users on the internet. It is also important to note that you can change hosting companies if the need arises, and it is possible to change your hosting company without changing your domain. But reach out to the new hosting company to ensure you follow the correct steps.

### Bundling Domains with Hosting

When it comes to choosing a hosting provider, you can look for one that bundles domains. This means the provider offers both hosting services and domain registration in one package. Bundling domains with hosting simplifies the process, as you won’t need to manage different accounts with different providers. Something to take note of is you can also buy domain names separately before signing up with a hosting company.

### Buying a domain separately

Purchasing the domain separately gives you more control over your domain settings. It also makes it easier to switch hosting providers. Just remember to keep track of your domain registration renewal dates. The first step is to select a domain registrar, which is a company that manages the reservation of domain names. Secondly, search and select a domain name. You can also choose country-specific domains if you prefer. Then, you can register the domain, configure domain settings, and then choose a hosting provider.

### Selecting a Hosting Provider

When selecting a hosting provider, consider factors like, number one, reliability. Choose a provider with a good track record for uptime and reliable customer support. Number two, is scalability. Opt for a provider that allows you to upgrade your hosting plan as your website grows easily. Number three, is security. Ensure the hosting provider offers robust security features such as SSL certificates and regular backups. Number four, is a user-friendly interface. Look for a provider with an intuitive control panel that makes it easy to manage your website. And lastly, affordability. Compare pricing plans to find a provider that offers the right features within your budget. Let’s see all of this in action. If you visit a hosting provider, you will usually see different pricing plans with the relevant features and information that you need to make an informed decision.

### Summary

To sum up, understanding the distinction between a host and a domain is crucial for anyone looking to create a website. Remember, the host provides the space and resources for your website, while the domain serves as its unique address on the internet. To put it differently, a website hosting company provides a space on the internet, a server where your website’s files are stored. This enables people to access your website anytime by typing its address or its domain.

### One-click solutions

Many hosting companies also provide one-click solutions, allowing you to register a domain name, install WordPress, and set up hosting literally in one click. This process removes any technical hurdles for users.

### Hosting companies

There are a plethora of hosting companies to select from, and you have the choice to host your site wherever you choose. Please note these are only some examples, and there are many more hosting companies to explore.

### Conclusion

When you have registered a domain name and have selected a hosting provider, you can start planning and designing your site.

Hi and welcome to Learn WordPress. In this tutorial, we'll be discussing an

00:05 --> 00:09  
essential aspect of setting up your website: choosing the right website

00:09 --> 00:11  
domain and hosting provider.

### Learning Outcomes

00:11 --> 00:15
The learning outcomes for this lesson are to

00:15 --> 00:19  
differentiate between domains and hosting, describe what it means to bundle

00:19 --> 00:25  
domains and identify factors to consider when choosing a hosting company.

### Understanding Domains and Hosting

00:25 --> 00:31  
Let's start by clarifying the difference between a host and a domain. Imagine your

00:31 --> 00:37  
website is a mobile home, and your domain is the address, and your host is the land

00:37 --> 00:43  
where your house or website is built. A domain is the unique web address that

00:43 --> 00:48  
visitors type into their browsers to find your site. For example, the domain

00:48 --> 00:55  
name for the official Coca-Cola website is www.cocacolacompany.com. On the

00:55 --> 00:59  
other hand, a host is a service that stores your website's files and makes

00:59 --> 01:04  
them accessible to users on the internet. It is also important to note that you

01:04 --> 01:09  
can change hosting companies if the need arises, and it is possible to change your

01:09 --> 01:15  
hosting company without changing your domain. But reach out to the new hosting

01:15 --> 01:20  
company to ensure you follow the correct steps.

### Bundling Domains with Hosting

01:20 --> 01:25  
When it comes to choosing a hosting provider, you can look for one that bundles domains. This means the

01:25 --> 01:30  
provider offers both hosting services and domain registration in one package.

01:30 --> 01:35  
Bundling domains with hosting simplifies the process, as you won't need to manage

01:35 --> 01:40  
different accounts with different providers. Something to take note of is

01:40 --> 01:44  
you can also buy domain names separately before signing up with a hosting company.

### Buying a Domain separately

01:44 --> 01:49  
By purchasing the domain separately, you have more control over your domain

01:49 --> 01:54  
settings. It also makes it easier to switch hosting providers. Just remember to

01:54 --> 01:59  
keep track of your domain registration renewal dates. The first step is to

01:59 --> 02:03  
select a domain registrar, which is a company that manages the reservation of

02:03 --> 02:09  
domain names. Secondly, search and select a domain name. You can also choose

02:09 --> 02:13  
country-specific domains if you prefer. Then you can register the domain,

02:13 --> 02:20  
configure domain settings, and then choose a hosting provider.

### Selecting a Hosting Provider

02:20 --> 02:26  
When selecting a hosting provider, consider factors like number one, reliability. Choose a provider

02:26 --> 02:31  
with a good track record for uptime and reliable customer support. Number two,

02:31 --> 02:36  
scalability. Opt for a provider that allows you to easily upgrade your hosting

02:36 --> 02:42  
plan as your website grows. Number three, security. Ensure the hosting provider

02:42 --> 02:47  
offers robust security features such as SSL certificates and regular backups.

02:47 --> 02:53  
Number four, user-friendly interface. Look for a provider with an intuitive control

02:53 --> 02:59  
panel that makes it easy to manage your website. And lastly, affordability. Compare

02:59 --> 03:03  
pricing plans to find a provider that offers the right features within your

03:03 --> 03:08  
budget. So let's see all of this in action. If you visit a hosting provider

03:08 --> 03:12  
you will usually see different pricing plans with the relevant features and

03:12 --> 03:19  
information that you need to make an informed decision.

### Summary

To sum up, understanding the distinction between a host and a domain is crucial for anyone looking to

03:23 --> 03:28  
create a website. Remember, the host provides the space and resources for your

03:28 --> 03:35
