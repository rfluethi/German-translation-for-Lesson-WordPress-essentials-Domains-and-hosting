Hello and welcome to Learn WordPress.
*00:00-00:02*

Say hello to your new WordPress website.
*00:02-00:06*

At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.
*00:06-00:12*

Let's change that now.
*00:12-00:13*

In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider,
*00:13-00:18*

and get the right domain.
*00:18-00:22*

If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.
*00:22-00:26*

We'll explain everything in detail.
*00:27-00:30*

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what hosting and domains are,
*00:30-00:35*

why you need both,
*00:35-00:39*

and how to choose the right provider.
*00:39-00:44*

Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.
*00:44-00:48*

Your website needs a place to stay.
*00:48-00:51*

This place is called hosting.
*00:51-00:54*

It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.
*00:56-00:59*

There are many different types of hosting.
*00:59-01:03*

And if needed, your website can even be moved.
*01:03-01:07*

Your website likes it here.
*01:07-01:11*

But is this really the right provider?
*01:11-01:15*

Let's ask your website what's important for it.
*01:15-01:18*

Reliability.
*01:18-01:22*

Your website needs to be online at all times.
*01:22-01:25*

A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.
*01:25-01:30*

Scalability.
*01:30-01:33*

If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.
*01:33-01:37*

Security.
*01:37-01:39*

A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.
*01:39-01:45*

User-friendliness.
*01:45-01:49*

Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.
*01:49-01:53*

Value for money.
*01:54-01:56*

Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.
*01:56-02:00*

Now your website knows what matters.
*02:00-02:03*

And it has chosen the right hosting provider.
*02:03-02:08*

But how can people find your website?
*02:08-02:13*

For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.
*02:13-02:18*

You can rent one from a domain registrar.
*02:18-02:22*

Most hosting providers will handle this for you.
*02:24-02:26*

So it's really easy.
*02:26-02:29*

If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.
*02:29-02:33*

This way, your website will always be available at the same address.
*02:33-02:39*

Let's summarize.
*02:39-02:41*

Hosting.
*02:41-02:44*

Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server.
*02:44-02:49*

So that it's accessible at all times.
*02:51-02:54*

Domain.
*02:54-02:55*

Your domain is your website's address on the internet.
*02:55-03:01*

It helps visitors find your website.
*03:01-03:04*

Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online,
*03:04-03:11*

and is always accessible.
*03:11-03:13*

Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,
*03:13-03:19*

you can start designing your website.
*03:20-03:22*

Are you wondering how to do that?
*03:22-03:27*
