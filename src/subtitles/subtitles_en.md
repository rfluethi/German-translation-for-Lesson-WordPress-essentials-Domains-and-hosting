Hello and welcome to learn WordPress.
*00:00-00:01*

Say hello to your new WordPress website.
*00:04-00:06*

At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.
*00:08-00:11*

Let's change that now. In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider.
*00:12-00:17*

And get the right domain. If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.
*00:21-00:25*

We'll explain everything in detail.
*00:27-00:29*

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what hosting and domains are, why you need
*00:30-00:38*

both, and how to choose the right provider.
*00:40-00:44*

Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.
*00:45-00:48*

Your website needs a place to stay.
*00:49-00:51*

This place is called hosting.
*00:52-00:54*

It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.
*00:56-00:59*

There are many different types of hosting and if needed, your website can even be moved.
*01:01-01:07*

Your website likes it here.
*01:09-01:11*

But is this really the right provider?
*01:12-01:14*

Let's ask your website what's important for it.
*01:16-01:18*

Reliability.
*01:20-01:21*

Your website needs to be online at all times.
*01:22-01:24*

A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.
*01:24-01:30*

Scalability.
*01:31-01:32*

If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.
*01:33-01:37*

Security.
*01:38-01:39*

A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.
*01:40-01:45*

User-friendliness.
*01:47-01:48*

Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.
*01:50-01:53*

Value for money.
*01:55-01:55*

Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.
*01:56-02:00*

Now your website knows what matters.
*02:01-02:03*

And it has chosen the right hosting provider.
*02:05-02:07*

But how can people find your website?
*02:10-02:12*

For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.
*02:15-02:18*

You can rent one from a domain registrar.
*02:20-02:22*

Most hosting providers will handle this for you.
*02:24-02:26*

So it's really easy.
*02:27-02:28*

A domain is unique worldwide.
*02:30-02:31*

No one else can use it at the same time.
*02:32-02:34*

It's made up of the second-level domain name you choose,
*02:35-02:38*

for example, my website,
*02:38-02:40*

and a top-level domain extension like.com.de or.net.
*02:40-02:45*

You've got hundreds of top-level domain options, as long as the one you want is still available.
*02:47-02:52*

If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.
*02:54-02:57*

This way, your website will always be available at the same address.
*02:59-03:03*

Let's summarize.
*03:05-03:06*

Hosting
*03:07-03:08*

Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server.
*03:11-03:14*

so that it's accessible at all times.
*03:16-03:18*

Domain
*03:20-03:20*

Your domain is your website's address on the internet.
*03:22-03:25*

It helps visitors find your website.
*03:27-03:29*

Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online
*03:31-03:35*

and is always accessible.
*03:35-03:37*

Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,
*03:39-03:43*

You can start designing your website.
*03:45-03:47*

Are you wondering how to do that?
