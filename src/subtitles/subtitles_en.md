**00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,000**
Hello and welcome to learn WordPress.

**00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000**
Say hello to your new WordPress website.

**00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,078**
At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.

**00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,922**
Let's change that now.

**00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:21,279**
In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider.

**00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,540**
And get the right domain. If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.

**00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,880**
We'll explain everything in detail.

**00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,806**
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand

**00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:37,885**
what hosting and domains are,

**00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:45,799**
why you need both, and how to choose the right provider.

**00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,439**
Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.

**00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,860**
Your website needs a place to stay.

**00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,260**
This place is called hosting.

**00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,860**
It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.

**00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,171**
There are many different types of hosting

**00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:11,159**
and, if needed, your website can even be moved.

**00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,280**
Your website likes it here.

**00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,959**
But is this really the right provider?

**00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,239**
Let's ask your website what's important for it.

**00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,604**
Reliability.

**00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:26,704**
Your website needs to be online at all times.

**00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:34,499**
A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.

**00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,893**
Scalability.

**00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:42,479**
If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.

**00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,787**
Security.

**00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:52,579**
A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.

**00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,120**
User-friendliness.

**00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,740**
Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.

**00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,700**
Value for money.

**00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,780**
Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.

**00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,300**
Now your website knows what matters.

**00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,480**
And it has chosen the right hosting provider.

**00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,300**
But how can people find your website?

**00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,240**
For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.

**00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,419**
You can rent one from a domain registrar.

**00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,959**
Most hosting providers will handle this for you.

**00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,180**
So it's really easy.

**00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,280**
A domain is unique worldwide, no one else can use it at the same time.

**00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,045**
It's made up of the second level domain name you choose, for example,
“My-Website”,

**00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:53,499**
and a top-level domain extension like .com .de or .net.

**00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,704**
You've got hundreds of top-level domain options,

**00:02:56,704 --> 00:03:00,582**
as long as the one you want is still available.

**00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:06,019**
If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.

**00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,760**
This way, your website will always be available at the same address.

**00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,130**
Let's summarize:

**00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,599**
Hosting

**00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,959**
Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server so that it's accessible at all
times.

**00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,025**
Domain

**00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:34,417**
Your domain is your website's address on the internet.

**00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:38,459**
It helps visitors find your website.

**00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,362**
Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online

**00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:47,187**
and is always accessible.

**00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:52,573**
Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,

**00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:56,719**
you can start designing your website.

**00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,690**
Are you wondering how to do that?

**00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,520**
