00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello and welcome to Learn WordPress.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,400
Say hello to your new WordPress website.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,320
At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,520
Let's change that now.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,000
In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
and get the right domain.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll explain everything in detail.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what hosting and domains are,

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
why you need both,

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,320
and how to choose the right provider.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,560
Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Your website needs a place to stay.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
This place is called hosting.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,360
It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,680
There are many different types of hosting.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,520
And if needed, your website can even be moved.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
Your website likes it here.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
But is this really the right provider?

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
Let's ask your website what's important for it.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
Reliability.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Your website needs to be online at all times.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,960
A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Scalability.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,920
If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Security.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,840
A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
User-friendliness.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,920
Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Value for money.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
Now your website knows what matters.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
And it has chosen the right hosting provider.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
But how can people find your website?

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,560
For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
You can rent one from a domain registrar.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,960
Most hosting providers will handle this for you.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,040
So it's really easy.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,360
This way, your website will always be available at the same address.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Let's summarize.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
Hosting.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
So that it's accessible at all times.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
Domain.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,440
Your domain is your website's address on the internet.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
It helps visitors find your website.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,040
Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online,

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,520
and is always accessible.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,960
you can start designing your website.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,440
Are you wondering how to do that?

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,400
