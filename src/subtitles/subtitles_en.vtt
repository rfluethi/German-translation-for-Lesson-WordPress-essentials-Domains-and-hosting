00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.940
Hello and welcome to learn WordPress.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.100
Say hello to your new WordPress website.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.680
At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.780
Let's change that now. In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.820
And get the right domain. If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.500
We'll explain everything in detail.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.700
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what hosting and domains are, why you need

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.000
both, and how to choose the right provider.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.280
Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.180
Your website needs a place to stay.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.020
This place is called hosting.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.040
It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.360
There are many different types of hosting and if needed, your website can even be moved.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.140
Your website likes it here.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.880
But is this really the right provider?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.860
Let's ask your website what's important for it.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.440
Reliability.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480
Your website needs to be online at all times.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.520
A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.840
Scalability.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.920
If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.460
Security.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.800
A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.920
User-friendliness.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.640
Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.920
Value for money.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.400
Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.420
Now your website knows what matters.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.760
And it has chosen the right hosting provider.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.760
But how can people find your website?

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.260
For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
You can rent one from a domain registrar.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.880
Most hosting providers will handle this for you.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.820
So it's really easy.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.880
A domain is unique worldwide.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.480
No one else can use it at the same time.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.740
It's made up of the second-level domain name you choose,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.200
for example, my website,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540
and a top-level domain extension like.com.de or.net.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.640
You've got hundreds of top-level domain options, as long as the one you want is still available.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.600
If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.440
This way, your website will always be available at the same address.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.060
Let's summarize.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.640
Hosting

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.620
so that it's accessible at all times.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.560
Domain

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.840
Your domain is your website's address on the internet.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.080
It helps visitors find your website.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.340
Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.840
and is always accessible.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.740
Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.280
You can start designing your website.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.080
Are you wondering how to do that?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.780
