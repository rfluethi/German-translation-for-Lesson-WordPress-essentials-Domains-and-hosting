00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello and welcome to learn WordPress.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Say hello to your new WordPress website.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.078
At the moment, it doesn't have a home and feels a bit lonely.

4
00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.922
Let's change that now.

5
00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:21.279
In this lesson, you'll learn how to find a good hosting provider.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.540
And get the right domain. If you're not sure what that means, don't worry.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.880
We'll explain everything in detail.

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.806
By the end of this lesson, you'll understand

9
00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:37.885
what hosting and domains are,

10
00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:45.799
why you need both, and how to choose the right provider.

11
00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.439
Let's start by taking a closer look at hosting.

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.860
Your website needs a place to stay.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.260
This place is called hosting.

14
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.860
It's where all your content is stored and where it functions.

15
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.171
There are many different types of hosting

16
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:11.159
and, if needed, your website can even be moved.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.280
Your website likes it here.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.959
But is this really the right provider?

19
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.239
Let's ask your website what's important for it.

20
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.604
Reliability.

21
00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:26.704
Your website needs to be online at all times.

22
00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:34.499
A good provider guarantees stable availability and offers reliable support.

23
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.893
Scalability.

24
00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:42.479
If your website grows, your hosting provider should be able to grow with it.

25
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.787
Security.

26
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:52.579
A good provider protects your website with SSL certificates and firewalls.

27
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.120
User-friendliness.

28
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.740
Managing your hosting should be simple and intuitive.

29
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.700
Value for money.

30
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.780
Your provider should offer a good balance of cost and quality.

31
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.300
Now your website knows what matters.

32
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.480
And it has chosen the right hosting provider.

33
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.300
But how can people find your website?

34
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.240
For that, it needs a domain, its address on the internet.

35
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.419
You can rent one from a domain registrar.

36
00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.959
Most hosting providers will handle this for you.

37
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.180
So it's really easy.

38
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.280
A domain is unique worldwide, no one else can use it at the same time.

39
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.045
It's made up of the second level domain name you choose, for example,  “My-Website”,

40
00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:53.499
and a top-level domain extension like .com .de or .net.

41
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.704
You've got hundreds of top-level domain options,

42
00:02:56.704 --> 00:03:00.582
as long as the one you want is still available.

43
00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:06.019
If you switch providers, you can take your domain with you.

44
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.760
This way, your website will always be available at the same address.

45
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.130
Let's summarize:

46
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.599
Hosting

47
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.959
Hosting stores your WordPress website on a server so that it's accessible at all times.

48
00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.025
Domain

49
00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:34.417
Your domain is your website's address on the internet.

50
00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:38.459
It helps visitors find your website.

51
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.362
Together, hosting and a domain ensure that your website stays online

52
00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:47.187
and is always accessible.

53
00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:52.573
Once you've registered a domain and chosen a hosting provider,

54
00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:56.719
you can start designing your website.

55
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.690
Are you wondering how to do that?

56
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.520
